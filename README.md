# Sulfide
Some useful libraries and frameworks for integrated development environments. 

Sulfide is a starting point for developing your own IDE. All it really is is a text editor (AvalonEdit) bundled with docking window system (DockPanel Suite) with everything wired in and working for syntax highlighting, basic clipboard operations and opening/saving files. Printing is very basic but works. The rest is down to you.
